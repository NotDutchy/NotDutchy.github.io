                    <p> During this project we worked in groups of 5-6 students and were tasked to get data from a local
                        database. This data came from a Weatherstation on the roof of the schoolbuilding.
                        We had to convert these values into values that were common in the Netherlands (Fahrenheit >
                        Celcius). As this was our first project, it taught us how to think like programmers on a basic
                        level
                        and introduced us to algorithms. <br> <br> In the video to the left, you can see our finished
                        product. We built in a menu on the bottom display. Navigation is done by using the buttons on
                        the bottom. <br> <br> Sadly during this project we did not use git or Github yet. The source
                        code is downloadable via the link below.

                    <li><span>Programming in Java</span><br>As this was our first project as Computer Science students. We started from the very basics with programming in Java. 
                    We learned to think like programmers and started learning algorithms. We also learned some basic general knowledge like converting values from different metric systems to others.</li>
                    <li><span>Algorithms</span><br>As mentioned in the point above, we learned some basic algorithms and made our own to display the values. I used a program called LARP to visualize the different algorithms. Sadly this program was rather out of date and was very annoying to use.</li>  
                    <li><span>Working with other people</span><br>I also learned to work in groups. This is essential for Computer Engineers as later during employment projects are also mostly done in groups. </li>

                    <li><span>Most Rainrate</span><br>Near the end of the project each student was required to make their own algorithm. There were a couple of different statistics to chooce from. I ended up determining the which month had the higher rain rate. I had to write my own algorithm to determine which month had the highest amount of rain.</li>
