            <h1 class="sub-title">Project Quizteling</h1>
            <p> During this project we worked on a mobile experience for a fictional amusement park. The experience had
                to include different aspects of our whole first year. This includes UML Diagrams, Hardware interfacing
                and the MQTT protocol.
                I created an android application that takes players through different parts of the park by asking them
                different questions that can sometimes only be answered by going to specific parts of the park.
                <br> We ended up creating a simple game of simon says. We 3D printed a set of owls that had LEDs in their eyes. The ESP32 would open a door and light up a random pair of eyes. The ESP would then send the correct answer that lit up to the MQTT broker so that the player can enter the correct answer.<br>

We had to create both an android application that is able to sent and receive information from the server. But also we need the ESP32 to be able to receive and send information.</li>
